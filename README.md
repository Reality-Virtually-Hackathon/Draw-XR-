# DrawXR
# Jesture

Jesture is a collaborative VR/AR guessing game loosely based on the classic party game Pictionary. One player enters VR and selects a theme. They are given a word or phrase and have two minutes to draw it. The other players stand around the first player with the corresponding mobile app to watch what Player 1 draws in AR and try to guess the drawing. Players are encouraged to interact with drawings in a 3D space.
